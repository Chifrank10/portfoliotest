# HR Data Analysis and Dashboard Creation

This project involves cleaning, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and querying HR data using MySQL. The insights obtained from the analysis are then visualized using Power BI to create an interactive dashboard. The data sources for this project include an HRIS (Human Resources Information System) and Excel CSV files.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide valuable insights into HR data through data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization. By leveraging MySQL for data manipulation and Power BI for visualization, we've created an informative and user-friendly dashboard that empowers HR professionals, managers, and decision-makers.

## Technologies Used

- **MySQL:** Used to clean, transform, and query HR data from the HRIS and Excel CSV files.
- **Power BI:** Employed to create interactive and visually appealing data visualizations and dashboards.

## Data Cleaning and EDA

The initial step involved cleaning and preparing the HR data collected from the HRIS and Excel CSV files. The data cleaning process included handling missing values, resolving duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies within the data. Various statistical and visual techniques were used to gain a deeper understanding of the workforce's distribution, demographics, roles, and more.

## MySQL Queries

MySQL was employed to perform insightful queries on the cleaned data. These queries were designed to extract meaningful information, such as employee distribution by department, location, age group, and tenure. Sample queries include:

- Retrieving the count of employees in each department.
- Calculating the average age of employees in different roles.
- Analyzing employee tenure distribution.

## Power BI Dashboard

Using Power BI, we transformed the query results into a dynamic and interactive dashboard. The dashboard includes:

- **Employee Distribution by Department:** A bar chart illustrating the distribution of employees across different departments.
- **Age Group Analysis:** A histogram displaying the age distribution of employees.
- **Location Insights:** A map showcasing employee distribution across various office locations.
- **Tenure Overview:** A line chart illustrating the tenure distribution of employees.
- **Role Breakdown:** A pie chart visualizing the distribution of employees based on their roles.

## Usage

1. **Data Cleaning and MySQL Queries:**
   - Load the HR data from the HRIS and Excel CSV files into MySQL.
   - Run the provided SQL queries to clean, transform, and analyze the data.

2. **Power BI Dashboard:**
   - Import the cleaned data or connect to the MySQL database.
   - Utilize the Power BI file provided to explore the pre-built dashboard visualizations.

## Data Sources

- **HRIS:** Extracted HR data from the organization's Human Resources Information System.
- **Excel CSV Files:** Collected supplementary data from Excel CSV files containing employee records.

## Installation

1. **MySQL:**
   - Install MySQL and set up the required database.
   - Execute the SQL scripts to create tables and load data from the provided CSV files.

2. **Power BI:**
   - Install Power BI Desktop to open and explore the provided Power BI file.
